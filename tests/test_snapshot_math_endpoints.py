"""Phase F — INDEPENDENT golden anchor for the math endpoints (chronometry).

Why this file exists (reviewer finding H-1)
-------------------------------------------
The existing anti-mockup tests (``test_chronometry_frame.py`` /
``test_chronometry_endpoint.py``) recompute every expected value by calling
the SAME engine functions the endpoint calls. That proves
``endpoint == in-process module`` — but it does NOT prove the engine's
physics is correct: stubbing ``SwissEphBackend.sun_lon_deg_ut`` to a constant
left all of those tests GREEN, because both sides moved together.

This module adds the missing INDEPENDENT layer for the canonical instant
**1990-06-15T14:30:00 Europe/Berlin, lat 52.52, lon 13.405**:

1. A FROZEN golden snapshot of the full ``ChronometryFrame`` (via the repo's
   ``UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS`` mechanism, ephemeris-tag-split into
   ``tests/snapshots/{moseph,swieph}/chronometry_*.json``). The frozen value
   is a fixed constant on disk, so a stub-constant engine — which produces a
   *different* constant — makes the snapshot assertion FAIL. (constant ≠
   frozen value).

2. Independent physics sanity asserts. These ballparks are NOT recomputed
   from the engine; they are hardcoded from real astronomy (cross-checked
   against the Meeus low-precision Sun + NOAA equation-of-time algorithms,
   see the module docstring of each assert). A fabricated engine value is
   caught even if someone regenerated the snapshot to match the fabrication.

Together: the snapshot locks regression + kills a stub-constant; the physics
asserts kill a regenerated-but-wrong golden. The endpoint↔module tests are
kept (they prove the router adds no hidden math) — this is the orthogonal,
independent anchor.

Set UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 to (re)generate the golden:
