"""FBP-02-004 — Zi-day boundary on effective time.

Today apply_day_boundary("zi") naively returns dt + 1h regardless of
the request's time standard. Phase 2 routes the boundary check through
the ruleset's day_change_policy: when time_standard_for_day_rollover
is "TLST" and the request itself uses TLST, the boundary fires at
tlst_hours >= zi_start_hour (HALF_OPEN, 23.0 per shipped ruleset).

Madrid is chosen as the test fixture because it sits ~75 min west of
the CET standard meridian, so civil 23:00 has TLST ≈ 21:30 — a clear
divergence between the legacy clock-based check (rolls over at civil
23) and the TLST-aware check (no rollover until apparent solar 23:00).
