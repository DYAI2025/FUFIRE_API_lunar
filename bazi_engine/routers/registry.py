"""
registry.py — declarative router mount registry.

Single source of the dual-mount idiom (CLAUDE.md "Mount idiom"). Adding an
endpoint = one router module + ONE Mount line here.
tests/test_app_composition.py (route snapshot) and
tests/test_rate_limit_coverage.py enforce the rest.

Mount order is load-bearing (route matching and OpenAPI path ordering follow
registration order). ``mount_all`` preserves the historical app.py order:
legacy public mounts first (frozen for Bazodiac compatibility), then the /v1
versioned surface, then schema-hidden internal mounts.
