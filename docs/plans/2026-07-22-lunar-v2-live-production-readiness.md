# FuFirE Lunar V2 — Live Production Readiness Completion Plan

Status: **BLOCKED — implementation-prepared; production promotion is not authorized**  
Last updated: 2026-07-22  
Engine repository: `DYAI2025/FUFIRE_API_lunar`  
Portal repository: `DYAI2025/FuFire_API_LIVE`  
Machine-readable gate state: `evidence/release-readiness/live-production-gates.json`

This repository-local plan operationalizes the approved Lunar V2 readiness intake. It is not a release approval and must not be used to infer that Railway, DNS, Legal, Product, Security, SRE, Portal, staging, production, or rollback evidence exists.

<!-- GOAL_START -->
Goal: release Lunar V2 only after the complete `Browser/Developer Portal -> BFF/Proxy -> api.fufire.space -> POST /v2/astronomy/lunar-state -> SWIEPH` path is evidenced against one approved commit and immutable image digest. Production readiness requires closed contract, security, ephemeris, performance, observability, legal, deployment, domain, promotion, and rollback gates. Existing V1 contracts remain compatible and Lunar remains V2-only. Missing values are never estimated, required live tests never silently skip, and no secret, API key, personal request data, or confidential license content may enter logs or evidence. The final release decision may become `RELEASE` only when every mandatory gate is `CLOSED`, the public OpenAPI and `/build` identity match the approved artifact, the portal browser path works without mocks, and rollback to the previous healthy digest has been rehearsed.
<!-- GOAL_END -->

## SMART-CONTEXT

### Current situation

- The Lunar endpoint, V2 mount, repository OpenAPI, locked ephemeris inputs, SWIEPH reference tests, readiness policy, and atomic CI gate exist in the Engine repository.
- On 2026-07-22, `main` was safely fast-forwarded to `master`; both now point to `d51df762746591aa6928edec9459fff18aa606fc`.
- GitHub still reports `master` as the default branch. Railway source-branch, current deployment identity, staging, domain, branch rules, release identity, legal approval, performance, observability, and rollback evidence are not available in this repository.
- Stale PRs #6 and #16 were closed as superseded. Production promotion remains blocked.

### System boundary

In scope: Engine code and contracts, GitHub control plane, immutable image/SBOM/attestation, Railway staging and production, `api.fufire.space`, auth/CORS/Redis/readiness, SWIEPH verification, portal OpenAPI mirror, explicit V2 catalog support, BFF request validation, browser E2E, monitoring, promotion, and rollback.

Out of scope: new interpretation features, topocentric Moon calculations, rise/set calculations, broad BaZi/Western/Fusion/ZWDS rewrites, unrelated portal redesign, PyPI publication, or a public container release outside the approved license path.

## Non-negotiable release invariants

1. No production release while license, astronomy tolerance, performance thresholds, branch protection, release identity, staging evidence, or rollback evidence is missing.
2. Build once; deploy Staging and Production by the same immutable digest.
3. Commit SHA, image digest, OpenAPI SHA, SBOM, attestation, release version, and ephemeris lock ID must be mutually traceable.
4. Repository or CI existence is not live evidence. The public domain and portal mirror must contain the Lunar operation.
5. Production must be fail-closed for API keys, explicit CORS, SWIEPH, required Redis policy, and dependency readiness.
6. Required direct, BFF, browser, failure-boundary, load, and rollback checks may not skip silently.
7. Evidence must not contain secrets, API keys, request bodies, birth/local-time data, or confidential license terms.

## Smallest robust implementation slice

The only implementation slice authorized before external approvals is:

1. Freeze and validate the repository-local gate state.
2. Remove stale PR ambiguity and safely synchronize `main` with `master` without force-push.
3. Fix source-level defects that do not infer missing policy values.
4. Add fail-closed machine validation: `RELEASE` is invalid whenever a mandatory gate is not `CLOSED`.
5. Open a bounded PR and use CI as integration evidence. Do not merge or tag based solely on local/source evidence.

## Required validation sequence after external gates close

### Engine

- Frozen dependency install and Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 full test suite with locked SWIEPH.
- Focused Lunar, readiness, runtime-config, release-evidence, workflow-contract, security, distribution, Docker, OpenAPI, and codegen checks.
- Exact image digest, CycloneDX SBOM, and independently verified provenance.
- Staging direct HTTP matrix, dependency failure injection, approved load profiles, alerts, and rollback rehearsal.

### Portal

- Exact Engine OpenAPI SHA sync.
- Explicit allowlisted V2 Lunar catalog and feature flag.
- BFF request validation and exact V2 forwarding tests.
- Non-skippable direct Engine, BFF, and Playwright browser tests without mocks.

### Production

1. Promote Engine digest.
2. Verify public `/build`, `/ready`, OpenAPI SHA, auth/error cases, and Lunar reference request.
3. Observe Engine-only window.
4. Promote Portal artifact with Lunar flag on.
5. Run full browser-to-SWIEPH smoke and joint observation window.
6. Change evidence decision from `BLOCKED` to `RELEASE` only after every mandatory gate is closed.

## Rollback order

1. Disable Lunar or restore the previous Portal artifact.
2. Restore the previous Engine digest if required.
3. Verify `/build`, `/ready`, auth, contract, and reference smoke.
4. Record deployment IDs, timestamps, recovery time, and final state without secrets.

## Release decision

**BLOCKED.** Branch-content convergence is complete, but default-branch cutover and the external legal, domain, release-identity, staging, performance, observability, public-domain, portal, promotion, and rollback gates are not evidenced. No tag, release, image promotion, DNS cutover, or production-final claim is authorized by this plan state.
