# FuFirE BaZi Precision — Deviation Register

**Purpose:** Track every defect, divergence, or open question identified
by the `BAZI-PRECISION-V2` initiative. Every deviation has an ID,
severity, evidence, owner, decision, and current status.

**Severity legend (per plan §15):**

| Sev | Definition |
|-----|------------|
| P0  | Blocker — authenticity, precision, or API contract directly at risk. |
| P1  | High — result still usable, but trust / trace gap. |
| P2  | Medium — domain depth missing; core remains correct. |
| P3  | Low — cleanup / docs / ergonomics. |

**Status legend:** `Open`, `In Review`, `Mitigated (v1)`, `Resolved
(v2)`, `Wontfix (justified)`, `Superseded`.

## DEV-2026-001 — `true_solar_time_used` is true when LMT is selected

- Component: `bazi_engine/routers/bazi.py` (derivation trace)
- Expected: Field `true_solar_time_used == true` only when the request
  uses *True* Local Solar Time (TLST = LMT + equation_of_time).
- Actual: `bazi_engine/routers/bazi.py:152` sets the field true whenever
  `time_standard == "LMT"`. LMT is *mean* solar, not true solar.
- Evidence: `bazi_engine/routers/bazi.py:152`; cross-checked against
  `bazi_engine/solar_time.py:17-60` which clearly distinguishes the two.
- Severity: P0
- Affected endpoints: `/calculate/bazi`, `/v1/calculate/bazi`,
  `/chart` (if it embeds the trace).
- Affected tests: `tests/test_pillar_trace.py` (currently asserts the
  field exists but not its semantic correctness).
- User-visible impact: API consumers reading the trace will believe a
  more precise time standard was used than was actually applied.
- Migration impact: Backward-compatible fix requires *adding* a
  separate `lmt_used` flag and correcting `true_solar_time_used` to be
  true only for TLST. The literal field value will change for any
  client currently calling with `time_standard=LMT`.
- Owner: Backend / API contracts (FBP-03-002 / FBP-03-003).
- Decision: Keep field for backward compatibility but document the
  bugfix in v1 release notes; correct semantics under v2.
- Status: Resolved (2026-05-17, FBP-03-002)
- Resolution: `true_solar_time_used` now true only for TLST; `lmt_used` bool added to
  `HourDerivationTrace`. Snapshots and OpenAPI spec regenerated. 2233 tests pass.

## DEV-2026-002 — Provenance `ruleset_id` default does not match ruleset filename

- Component: `bazi_engine/provenance.py` (default args) and
  `spec/rulesets/`.
- Expected: `ruleset_id` emitted in provenance corresponds 1:1 with a
  loadable ruleset file in `spec/rulesets/`.
- Actual: `bazi_engine/provenance.py:142` defaults to
  `"traditional_bazi_2026"`. The actual ruleset file is
  `spec/rulesets/standard_bazi_2026.json`. No
  `traditional_bazi_2026.json` exists.
- Evidence: `bazi_engine/provenance.py:142`; `ls spec/rulesets/`.
- Severity: P1
- Affected endpoints: All `/calculate/*` (provenance block).
- Affected tests: `tests/test_provenance.py` (must be checked against
  the actual loaded ruleset, not the string).
- User-visible impact: Provenance claims an identity that does not map
  to a loadable artifact. Audit trail integrity reduced.
- Migration impact: Either rename the ruleset file or change the
  default. Renaming the file is a downstream-visible change; changing
  the default is internal but requires regenerating snapshots.
- Owner: Provenance / ruleset team (FBP-03-004).
- Decision: Pending — defer until ruleset loader is wired through
  Phase 2 (FBP-02-001), then align both ends.
- Status: Open
- Review gate: FBP-02-001 + FBP-03-004.

## DEV-2026-003 — Engine version drift between `__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml`

- Component: `bazi_engine/__init__.py` vs `pyproject.toml`.
- Expected: Both report the same engine version, or `__version__` is
  derived from `pyproject.toml` at import time.
- Actual: prior to the mitigation, `bazi_engine/__init__.py:18` =
  `"1.0.0-rc1-20260220"` while `pyproject.toml:version` = `"1.0.0rc0"`
  — different rc levels.
- Evidence: see above; `CLAUDE.md` already documents this dual-source
  pattern and the requirement to bump both.
- Severity: P1
- Affected endpoints: All; the API exposes `__version__` via
  `/health`, `/api`, OpenAPI `info.version`, and provenance.
- Affected tests: `tests/test_rebrand.py` (version-string assertions),
  `tests/test_version_sources_aligned.py` (new regression guard).
- User-visible impact: OpenAPI advertised version differed from PyPI /
  installed package version.
- Migration impact: `pyproject.toml` bumped from `1.0.0rc0` →
  `1.0.0rc1` so the rc level matches `__init__.py`. The trailing
  `-20260220` build-identifier suffix is intentionally not on the
  PyPI side (PEP 440 would require `+20260220` local-version syntax;
  not worth the churn for this one bump). The two sources now share
  the rc level, which the new test pins.
- Owner: Release management.
- Decision: Mitigated for v1 by aligning rc levels. Full single-
  source-of-truth (e.g. `importlib.metadata.version()` driving
  `__version__`) is deferred to FBP-06-001.
- Status: Mitigated (v1) — 2026-05-14, commit pending.
- Review gate: FBP-06-001.

**Superseded — 2026-07-13:** The "keep both in lockstep" mitigation is
replaced, not fulfilled. `pyproject.toml`'s `version` is now owned by
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
(`release-please-config.json`), bumped automatically from Conventional
Commit messages on every merge to `main` — it is no longer a value a human
(or this repo) hand-edits to match `__init__.py`. `bazi_engine.__version__`
remains a separate, manually-curated engine-build label (API responses,
OpenAPI `info.version`, golden snapshot fixtures) with no required
relationship to the package version. `tests/test_version_sources_aligned.py`
no longer cross-checks the two; only `__version__`'s own shape is still
guarded there, and `tests/test_openapi_spec_version.py` guards
`__version__` against the OpenAPI spec. This intentionally makes
FBP-06-001's original framing ("drive `__version__` from `pyproject.toml`")
moot — the two are deliberately two different axes, not one that needs
single-sourcing.
- Status: **Superseded** (2026-07-13) — see release-please decoupling above.

## DEV-2026-008 — `/calculate/wuxing` and `/calculate/tst` use different TLST formulas

- Component: `bazi_engine/routers/fusion.py` `/calculate/wuxing`
  endpoint (line 211) vs `/calculate/tst` (post-Phase-1, delegating
  to `bazi_engine.time_context.compute_effective_time_context`).
- Expected: Both endpoints emit the same "true solar time" value for
  the same `(date, tz, lon)` input. The CIVIL → TLST conversion is
  defined as `civil_local + longitude/15h + equation_of_time` (≈ the
  formula `compute_effective_time_context.tlst_hours` uses).
- Actual: `/calculate/wuxing` calls
  `true_solar_time(civil_time_hours, req.lon, day_of_year)` without
  passing `timezone_offset_hours`. The `else` branch in
  `bazi_engine/solar_time.py:91-92` then treats the civil hours as
  if they were already LMT and only adds EoT. Effectively:
  `wuxing.true_solar_time = civil_hours + EoT_hours`
  `tst.true_solar_time_hours = civil_hours + lon/15 + EoT_hours`
  — the longitude correction is missing on the wuxing side.
- Evidence: `bazi_engine/routers/fusion.py:211`;
  `bazi_engine/solar_time.py:88-95` (the `if timezone_offset_hours is
  not None` branch); `bazi_engine/time_context.py:_compute_…`.
- Severity: P1 (cross-endpoint inconsistency; consumer-visible value
  drift for any non-zero longitude — ~6 min in Berlin, more
  elsewhere).
- Affected endpoints: `/calculate/wuxing`. `/calculate/tst` post-Phase-1
  is treated as the correct reference.
- Affected tests: none current — neither `tests/test_provenance.py`
  nor `tests/test_snapshot_stability.py` pins the exact
  `true_solar_time` numeric value at the wuxing endpoint.
- User-visible impact: For non-meridian longitudes the wuxing
  endpoint's `true_solar_time` field is offset from the tst
  endpoint's `true_solar_time_hours`. Downstream consumers that
  compare the two surfaces (or compute their own TLST off the wuxing
  value) see a silent drift.
- Migration impact: Fixing in `/v1` would change a numeric response
  field — a wire-breaking change for any client reading
  `equation_of_time` / `true_solar_time` on the wuxing endpoint. The
  Phase-0 freeze says "no silent v1 behavior change". So either:
  (a) ship the fix only under `/v2/calculate/wuxing` (FBP-06-001 era),
      keeping `/v1` numerically reproducible, or
  (b) deprecate the wuxing `true_solar_time` / `equation_of_time`
      fields in v1 (mark deprecated in OpenAPI; remove in v2) and
      direct callers to `/calculate/tst` for the canonical value.
  The Decision field below selects option (a); option (b) is recorded
  here for future review.
- Owner: API contracts (FBP-06-001 / wuxing v2).
- Decision: Defer to Phase 6 (`/v2/calculate/wuxing`). v1 keeps the
  current numeric value to preserve reproducibility of historic
  signatures.
- Status: Open (deferred to v2).
- Review gate: FBP-06-001.

## DEV-2026-004 — Day-cycle anchor unverified

- Component: `bazi_engine/constants.py:DAY_OFFSET`,
  `bazi_engine/bazi.py:sexagenary_day_index_from_date`,
  `spec/rulesets/standard_bazi_2026.json:day_cycle_anchor`.
- Expected: A single, verified anchor (date or JDN ↔ sexagenary index)
  cited from a domain-authoritative source, consumed by both core and
  `/validate`.
- Actual: Core uses hardcoded `DAY_OFFSET = 49` with comment "1949-10-01
  is Jia-Zi (0)"; ruleset has a parallel `anchor_jdn = 2419451` flagged
  `"anchor_verification": "unverified"` and label "Assumed JiaZi day
  (verify!)". The two are independent. Neither is verified.
- Evidence: `bazi_engine/constants.py:22`;
  `spec/rulesets/standard_bazi_2026.json:22-27,353`.
- Severity: P0 (blocker for v2 default switch).
- Affected endpoints: `/calculate/bazi`, `/calculate/fusion`, `/v1/*`,
  any derived feature (impact, daily, experience).
- Affected tests: `tests/test_invariants.py:16-18` (asserts literal
  `49` and two reference dates),
  `tests/test_constants.py:83-128` (multiple bounds and identity tests),
  `tests/test_golden.py` (indirectly through pillar values).
- User-visible impact: If the anchor is wrong, every day pillar is
  wrong by the corresponding offset; downstream signatures and
  fusion harmony scores all shift. The user has no way to detect this
  from the response today.
- Migration impact: Cannot be silently changed. Any anchor correction
  requires a migration report quantifying signature deltas
  (FBP-04-006). Until then, `/v1` is frozen and `/v2` is not opened.
- Owner: Domain expert + backend (FBP-02-002, FBP-02-003).
- Decision: Pending — `DOMAIN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`. Phase 2 may not change
  defaults; it may only add a `verified` track gated behind opt-in.
- Status: Open
- Review gate: FBP-02-003.

## DEV-2026-005 — `DAY_OFFSET == 49` asserted as truth in additional test file

- Component: `tests/test_constants.py:83-128`.
- Expected: Day-anchor tests reference an anchor ID / verification
  status, not the literal integer.
- Actual: Multiple assertions including `assert DAY_OFFSET == 49`,
  `> 0`, `< 60`, and "1949-10-01 should be Jia-Zi day with DAY_OFFSET=49".
- Evidence: see component.
- Severity: P1 (follow-up to FBP-02-002).
- Affected endpoints: None directly; pure invariant test.
- Affected tests: As component.
- User-visible impact: None; internal test brittleness.
- Migration impact: When FBP-02-002 ruleset-drives the anchor, these
  tests will fail-fast unless rewritten. Plan only explicitly covers
  `tests/test_invariants.py`.
- Owner: Test / domain (FBP-02-002 follow-up).
- Decision: Rewrite alongside FBP-02-002, retaining the bounds checks
  (`isinstance int`, `0 ≤ offset < 60`) but moving the literal 49 and
  the date-pinned cases to ruleset-driven equivalents.
- Status: Open
- Review gate: FBP-02-002.

## DEV-2026-006 — `ErrorEnvelope` is inlined in `app.py` rather than versioned in `spec/schemas/`

- Component: `bazi_engine/app.py:515,530` vs `spec/schemas/`.
- Expected: `spec/schemas/ErrorEnvelope.schema.json` exists; the
  application references it.
- Actual: The envelope is defined inline inside the OpenAPI
  customization function. There is no standalone schema file.
- Evidence: `ls spec/schemas/` shows only `refdata_manifest`,
  `ValidateRequest`, `ValidateResponse`.
- Severity: P2
- Affected endpoints: All (every error path).
- Affected tests: `tests/test_error_handling.py`,
  `tests/test_error_sanitization.py`,
  `tests/test_openapi_contract.py` (if it currently asserts the inline
  shape).
- User-visible impact: No runtime effect; reduces auditability and
  blocks RFC 9457 v2 planning.
- Migration impact: Extract is purely additive in v1; v2 may add
  Problem Details fields per RFC 9457.
- Owner: API contracts (FBP-03-005 / FBP-03-006).
- Decision: Extract under FBP-03-005, then add v2-only Problem Details
  fields under FBP-03-006. Existing inline copy retained for v1
  contract reproducibility.
- Status: Open
- Review gate: FBP-03-005.

## DEV-2026-007 — Wu-Xing model versioning collapsed into one `parameter_set.version` field

- Component: `bazi_engine/provenance.py:17-62`.
- Expected: Separate `vector_model_id`, `normalization_model_id`,
  `fusion_model_id`, `harmony_model_id`, `calibration_model_id` so
  v1/v2 parallel operation (FBP-04-005) is meaningful.
- Actual: Only a single `version: "1.1.0"` string on the
  `WUXING_PARAMETER_SET` dict.
- Evidence: `bazi_engine/provenance.py:18`.
- Severity: P1 (precondition for FBP-04-005).
- Affected endpoints: `/calculate/fusion`, `/calculate/wuxing`,
  `/impact/active`, `/experience/daily`.
- Affected tests: `tests/test_provenance.py`,
  `tests/test_fusion.py`, `tests/test_contribution_ledger.py`.
- User-visible impact: Cannot distinguish v1 vs v2 fusion output
  without a version-shaped contract.
- Migration impact: Additive at first (introduce new fields keyed
  alongside existing `parameter_set.version`); breaking only if the
  string is removed (don't).
- Owner: Fusion / Wu-Xing (FBP-04-002).
- Decision: Add new fields in FBP-03-004 and FBP-04-002. Keep
  `parameter_set.version` as deprecated alias until v2 fully replaces
  v1 default.
- Status: Partially resolved (2026-05-18, FBP-03-004)
  - `vector_model_id` surfaced in derivation trace `provenance_ids` block.
  - Remaining: per-sub-model IDs (normalization, fusion, harmony, calibration) tracked in FBP-04-002.
- Review gate: FBP-04-002.

## Security Findings Register

### SEC-2026-001: IDOR-1 — Superglue proxy accepts any user_id (Accepted)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | SEC-2026-001 |
| Severity | Low |
| Evidence | `bazi_engine/routers/superglue.py` — all proxy routes accept `user_id` path/query param validated only by regex, not by API key ownership |
| Owner | Engineering |
| Status | Accepted |

**Rationale:** The Superglue proxy routes are called exclusively by ElevenLabs service agents using service-level API keys, not by end users. There is no user-to-key binding in this trust model — the caller IS the service, acting on behalf of any user. Adding ownership checks would require a user registry that does not exist and would break the ElevenLabs integration.

**Mitigations in place:** Route-level rate limiting, API key authentication, Superglue-side authorization on the upstream service.

---

### SEC-2026-002: CREDS-1 — Superglue token in URL query string (Accepted)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | SEC-2026-002 |
| Severity | Low |
| Evidence | `bazi_engine/services/superglue_client.py` — token appended to URL as `?token=...` |
| Owner | Engineering |
| Status | Accepted |

**Rationale:** The Superglue API requires the token as a URL query parameter. This cannot be changed without a Superglue platform modification. The token is a server-side secret in the `SUPERGLUE_TOKEN` environment variable and is never exposed to clients. TLS in transit prevents interception; server-side logs are the only exposure surface.

**Mitigations in place:** Token stored as env var (not hardcoded), TLS enforced on Railway deployment, Superglue token is a service credential with no user data access.

## Decisions

### DECISION-DAYUN-002 — 2026-07-13 — Da-Yun decade dates: 360-day ritual year → real Gregorian years

The previous 360-day ritual-year date model — documented as "intentional" in `bazi_engine/routers/dayun.py` — is superseded. Decade `date_start`/`date_end` now track real Gregorian years (leap-aware) via `bazi_engine/dayun/dates.add_real_years`, because those fields are declared `format: date` in the response schema and were consumed downstream as real dates, where the old 3600-day decade drifted ~52 days per decade (~1.1 years by decade 8). `select_current` was aligned to the same real mean-year divisor (365.2425) so current-cycle selection agrees with the emitted dates. `start_age` (classical 3-days = 1-year) and the `age_start`/`age_end` real-year decimals are unchanged; the response shape is unchanged and `provenance.ruleset_id` stays `dayun_v1`.

### DECISION-ZWDS-001 — 2026-07-14 — ZWDS core-seed ruleset status, fixed policies, and PENDING GATE-1 practitioner review

The Zi Wei Dou Shu (ZWDS) natal engine ships as an explicit **core-seed**, not a universal or complete ZWDS engine. The `zwds.fufire.core-seed.v1` ruleset declares `source_status=SOURCE_NEEDED`, `school_label=null`, and is labelled `core-seed`: its output is engine-deterministic truth (byte-stable per fixed `(request, request_id, generated_at)` with a fixed ephemeris), **not** a practitioner- or historically-validated chart. The following policies are fixed and disclosed in every response's ruleset envelope: calendar `local-civil-day.v1` (swisseph-native 時憲曆 — day boundary follows the chart's effective-local frame; core-seed resolves in the `CIVIL` time standard); leap-month interpretation `split-after-day-15.guide-v1`; year-cycle basis `lunar-year.guide-v1` (year stem/branch from the lunar new year, not LiChun); Four-Transformations table `guide-four-transformations.v1` (the mainstream, iztro-corroborated tabulation, flagged `SOURCE_NEEDED` with the **contested** `GENG.HUA_KE` / `REN.HUA_KE` cells). The natal golden corpus (`tests/zwds/goldens/`, generated by `scripts/zwds/gen_natal_goldens.py`, locked by `tests/zwds/test_zwds_golden.py`) covers all 5 bureaus, all 10 year-stem transformation rows, leap-month, late-Zi, both direction methods + omit, and a non-CST birth — but comparator (`iztro`) agreement is recorded only as a `crosscheck` MATCH and is explicitly **not** historical proof. **GATE-1 human practitioner review of the natal charts is PENDING** (see `docs/zwds/golden-review.md`, the sole unchecked release-gate item). No fusion, dynamics, or interpretation layer is built on top of the natal chart until GATE-1 passes.
